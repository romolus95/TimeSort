# TimeSort
A project for my last year of computer science. A algorithm that adaquatly sorts an array with only 300 comparisons.
The arrays consist of double values and can be 100, 120, 140 or 160 elements long. The goal is that TimeSort can sort 90%
of all arrays with a kendall correlation to the completely sorted array of at least 0.4.

The initial idea is the usage of CombSort.
